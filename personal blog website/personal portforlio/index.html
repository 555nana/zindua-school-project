        <ol>
            <li>Project 1: E-commerce Web Application - Developed a fully functional e-commerce platform using modern web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and a backend framework like Django or Node.js). The platform includes user authentication, product browsing, a shopping cart, payment gateway integration (e.g., Stripe or PayPal), and an admin dashboard for managing orders and inventory. Optimized for mobile responsiveness and SEO, the project demonstrates expertise in full-stack web development, database management, and user experience design.</li>
            <li>Project 2: Data Analysis Dashboard -Created an interactive data analysis dashboard that visualizes key business metrics for decision-making. The dashboard is built using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, and a web framework (like Flask or Django). It integrates data from various sources (e.g., CSV, SQL databases, APIs), processes it, and presents it in charts, graphs, and tables. The project focuses on data cleaning, analysis, and visualization techniques to generate actionable insights. </li>
            <li>Project 3: IoT-Based Smart Home Automation System-Designed and implemented a smart home system that allows users to control home appliances (lights, thermostat, door locks) remotely via a mobile app. The system utilizes IoT devices like sensors, Raspberry Pi/Arduino, and cloud services to communicate with a mobile application built using Flutter or React Native. Features include real-time updates, user authentication, and energy usage monitoring.</li>
